Stranded here on Mars
What's the odds you'd get stuck here too?
It might be a lost cause
Who'd have thought there'd be so much left to lose?

Come hell or heaven, angels or devils
I won't move
And I don't care what happens after
I won't quit on you

Lonely astronaut, it's gonna cost
But you just can't beat that view
Wasted like a god, power off
Wake up somewhere new
Now I'm an alien to you

Come hell or heaven, angels or devils
I won't move
And I don't care what happens after
I won't quit on you

Come hell (hell) or heaven (heaven), angels (angels) or devils
I won't move (I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't)
And I don't (don't) care (care) what happens after
I won't quit on you (I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't)

Chaos-ridden inner space
Turns out home is not a place
When I think home, I see your face
Up there so long, everything changed

Chaos reaches outer space
Turns out nowhere is a place
Look down on a brilliant blaze
Phone, home, baby, everything changed

Come hell or heaven, angels or devils
I won't move
And I don't care what happens after
I won't quit on you

Chaos reaches outer space
Turns out nowhere is a place
Look down on a brilliant blaze
Phone, home, baby, everything changed
